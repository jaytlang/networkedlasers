REPO GUIDELINES:
-> Don't commit entire vivado projects, or output projects
   which are generated by pre-processing scripts, in order
   to save on repository size. Add these things to the
   .gitignore to be sure you're doing this right.

-> Utilize vivado's write_project_tcl to achieve the above.
   This is the deflate operation you should utilize prior
   to committing anything new. Inflate by sourcing this
   file at Vivado startup.

-> If you want to add new files, make them inside the correct
   directory and then import them into Vivado without selecting
   "Copy Into Project". Checking the output of write_project_tcl
   should help to make sure you've done this correctly.

-> Good commit messages, use signatures to assert who did what, 
   etc.
